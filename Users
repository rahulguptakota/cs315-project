1043565691``0``$24.95``$24.95``Hertz Corporation Bond Certificate 1970's``Scripophily Makes a Great Gift for Everyone Our Stocks are worth the paper they're printed on (sm) Our Company is a TRUSTED Buyer and Seller of Old Stock Certificates. Check out our About Me Page , where you can find out about us and read the recent articles about our company in Time Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, The Globe and Mail, Washington Post and our appearence on CNN. Beautifully engraved certificate from the Hertz Corporation issued in 1976-1977. This historic document was printed by the Security-Columbian Banknote Company and has an ornate border around it with a vignette of an allegorical man and woman sitting beside the company's logo. This item has the printed signatures of the company_s chairman (Robert L. Stone) and vice-president,finance and assistant secretary. This bond is over 34 years old. Hertz, the world's leading vehicle renting organization, is represented in over 140 countries, operating a fleet of 525,000 vehicles from approximately 6,500 locations. The pioneer of auto renting was Walter L. Jacobs who in September of 1918, at the age of 22, opened a car-rental operation in Chicago. Starting with a dozen Model T Fords, which he repaired and repainted himself, Jacobs expanded his operation to the point where, within five years, the business generated annual revenues of about $1 million. In 1923, Jacobs sold his car-rental concern to John Hertz, President of Yellow Cab and Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Company. Jacobs continued as Hertz' top operating and administrative executive. This rental business, called Hertz Drive-Ur-Self System, was acquired in 1926 by General Motors Corporation when it bought Yellow Truck from John Hertz. The Hertz Corporation In 1953, the Hertz properties were bought from GMC by the Omnibus Corporation, which divested itself of its bus interest and concentrated solely on car and truck renting and leasing. A year later, a new name was taken -- The Hertz Corporation -- and it was listed for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange. Jacobs became Hertz' first President and served in that post until his retirement in 1960. He died in 1985 at the age of 88. In 1954, the new corporation bought Metropolitan Distributors, a pioneer in New York truck leasing dating back to World War I and the largest concern of its kind in any one city. In the process, the head of Metropolitan, Leon C. Greenbaum, became Vice Chairman of the Hertz Board of Directors; he later became Chairman, and in 1960, Chief Executive Officer. In 1967, The Hertz Corporation became a wholly owned subsidiary of RCA Corporation and operated as a separate entity, with its own management and Board of Directors. In 1985, Hertz joined UAL, Inc. On December 30, 1987, Hertz was sold to Park Ridge Corporation, a company formed by Ford Motor Company and Hertz management, for the purpose of purchasing Hertz. In 1988, Volvo North America Corporation joined Ford and Hertz management as an investor in Park Ridge Corporation. In 1993, Park Ridge Corporation was merged into The Hertz Corporation. In 1994, Ford purchased the outstanding shares of Hertz and Hertz became an independent, wholly owned subsidiary of The Ford Motor Company. On April 25, 1997, Hertz became a publicly traded company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol &quot;HRZ.&quot; Hertz Today Hertz is headquartered in Park Ridge, New Jersey. Its current headquarters location opened in 1988. Prior to that the corporation was based in New York and, before that, Chicago. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is the site of Hertz' Worldwide Reservations Center and Data Center, established in 1970, and its Financial Center, established in 1994. Car rentals, the largest and best known of Hertz' activities, are conducted from more than 1,600 domestic, corporate and licensee locations, and approximately 4,500 corporate and licensee locations outside the United States. Hertz offers a wide variety of current-model cars on a short-term rental basis -- daily, weekly or monthly -- at airports, in downtown and suburban business centers, and in residential areas and resort locales. Today, Hertz' Worldwide Reservations System handles approximately 40 million phone calls and delivers in total approximately 30 million reservations annually This Authentic certificate looks great framed and is much nicer in person than the scan indicates.

1044078197``1``$6.99``$6.99``Set of 6 glass coasters w/characters``I am selling a set of 6 coasters with different characters on them. One is a ballerina with a pink and red dress. Another is a bartender with a big mustache mixing a drink. There is a man in his green pajamas (I think) holding his head with stars swimming around his head (possibly a headache). Next is a couple of drunks sitting by a lamppost. And the last two are the same of a dancer with a top hat sitting on a stool with a drink in his hand. These appear to be for a bar. I'm not sure how the ballerina fits into the picture. There is one other coaster that came with the set that is being listed seperately. It is a black man playing a saxaphone. If you are interested in it be sure to look at my auction. But note it will end a day earlier than this group. Also there is a coaster with no character that I will throw in if the winning bidder wants it. They need to let me know. These coasters are really, really cute. They are in great shape with no chips or cracks. The colors are very bright and nothing missing. There are some brown spots here and there, but you have to have them in good light to see the spots. I really believe the winning bidder is going to love them! There is no reserve. The buyer will be responsible for shipping charges and insurance if requested. I need to hear from you within 3 days after auction ends. Payment must be received within 10 days. I accept money orders, cashier checks, or personal checks that will need to clear. Don't forget to check out the other coaster! Thanks for looking and good luck bidding. E-mail if you have questions.``1007491154``1008355154``djaap.shawneelink.net``

A quick word to our long time friends and customers as well as new: Other eBay dealers sell hose and other items, but not too many take the time to give you a good description and, perhaps, a little history, tips, etc...... We thank all of you who have taken the time to view, bid on and win our auctions! As always, we're happy to answer your questions about hosiery or any of our items. You can pay for this auction with: Money Order, Personal Check (will send you the item when it clears), With Your Visa Or MasterCard in the U.S. You Can Use PayPal. PayPal is now available around the world. Click on the PayPal logo below or visit them at: http://www.paypal.com, or, If You're An International Bidder, You Can Use Bid Pay To Send A Western Union Money Order In U.S. DOLLARS! They are at http://www.bidpay.com And now a quick word about our rules of the road. Please Take 2 Minutes To Read This And Avoid Delays Or Misunderstandings: 1.) Please Pay For Your Item Within 5 Days. If You're Having An Emergency Or A Problem, Let Us Know, We'll Work With You. Items not paid for in the specified time may be withheld from the non-paying bidder and may relisted. 2.) Non-paying Bidders Will Receive A Non-Paying Bidders Notice To eBay And Face Negative Feedback, And Ultimately Termination Of Their eBay Account If They Make A Habit Of Not Paying For Auctions. 3.) All Sales Final Unless Otherwise Marked So Please Ask Any Questions Before You Bid. 4.) If You Win More Than One Item Within 24 Hours, Please Be Sure To Let Us Know, So You Can Enjoy Combined Shipping And Save Money 5.) Please Include A Copy Of The Notification Letter With Your Payment For Fastest Service, Whether You Pay By PayPal Or Snail Mail. If You Don't Please Be Sure To Include The eBay Auction Number For Each Item, As Well As A Small Description Of Your Item(s) For The Fastest Service! 6.) Unlike A Majority Of Dealers On eBay We Leave You Feedback A.S.A.P. After Receiving Your Payment. We Would Appreciate Positive Feedback From You If You're Happy With Your Item When You Receive It. 7.) All Money Order or Check Payments MUST be drawn on a U.S. Bank, in U.S. Dollars. For example: A Money Order From The Royal Canadian Bank in U.S. Dollars is NOT accepted, not because we don't like Canadians, but because our bank imposes a hefty fee for such money orders. Canadian and European customers are encouraged to use PayPal or Bid Pay for payments. 8.) If you pay with PayPal and you have won multiple items, PLEASE make only 1 PayPal Payment and include all the auction numbers on the one payment. It simplifies it for you and for me. Also, PayPal charges a transaction fee for EACH payment made, in addition to their OTHER fees to the seller. We combine shipping to save you money - please combine multiple auction PayPal payments into ONE to help keep our costs low, so we can KEEP providing Lower Cost combined shipping.... A quick check of our feedback will show you that nearly every other buyer buys from us more than once!! Also, a larger percentage of our feedback centers on our FAST SHIPPING!!! Are you tired of paying for an item and waiting for 2 weeks? Not with Kathy's Nostalgiabilia. We get your money on Monday, and your item goes out by Wednesday or sooner if possible!! Our shipping rates are still among the best on eBay, even with the recent rise in rates in the Post Office. For up to 4 pairs of stockings: In the U.S $2.50; Canada: $2.75; Europe: $3.75. If you win other than hosiery items, Please See Listing For Actual Shipping Rate, or buyer is responsible for reasonable shipping rate. Believe me, ours are among the best shipping rates on eBay!! Our feedback profile is proof we deliver, however, we are not responsible for loss of goods in the mail that are not insured. Insurance is extra and based on total. Insured items go out once a week: Monday. Non-insured items go out a.s.a.p. upon receipt of payment. Kathy's Nostalgia Guarantees Every Item To Be As Described Or Your Money Back!

1044429906``0``$3.05``$3.05``1967 March Boris Karloff #17 March Gold Key``Very solid comic, no missing or loose pages, no folded page corners, minimal handling evidence, colors good inside and out, slight age browning at the page extremes. Has pinup/poster back page. Buyer pays $1.95 for First Class shipping and handling to any destination in the USA and I will always combine multiple wins to get the best possible shipping rate. Insured shipping is optional but reasonable (starts at under a dollar and goes up depending on the value of the item, fragility of the item, etc.) I accept just about any kind of payment: All major credit cards are accepted directly and without fees: Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express. I also accept Money Orders, Personal Checks, Business Checks, Cashier Checks and even straight Wampum. And of course, I honor basically all the payment services: Billpoint, PayPal, BidPay and PayDirect, with PayPal being perhaps the most convenient for both Buyer and Seller. My personal preference, though, is plain old checks and Money Orders. That may seem a little old fashioned, but online payment services are actually quite costly. Did you know that in most cases the Seller winds up paying PayPal and Billpoint more than the amount paid to eBay in Final Value Fees? Believe me, that's a fact. Online payment services are very convenient but they do drive up the costs for Sellers, so eventually this winds up costing all of us a little bit more. Please feel free to contact me directly via email at LindaGHTX@aol.com I Guarantee Total Satisfaction -- if you are unhappy with your purchase for any reason just return the item and I will refund all you've paid plus reimburse you for return shipping.

It is dated, (1927). She sent him a photo of herself, with a haughty look and other &quot;signs&quot; that she is upset. This is a fascinating insight into a very mysterious man. I think this was probably from a family member, as he was dedicated to Marion davies at this time..(so I understand; he also was somewhat of a ladies man.) This is a unusual collectable.

Has a little edge wear on the spine binding edge, other 3 edges very good, has slight forward roll and light age browning at the page exteriors but overall quite sound and good. Buyer pays $1.95 for First Class shipping and handling to any destination in the USA and I will always combine multiple wins to get the best possible shipping rate. Insured shipping is optional but reasonable (starts at under a dollar and goes up depending on the value of the item, fragility of the item, etc.) I accept just about any kind of payment: All major credit cards are accepted directly and without fees: Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express. I also accept Money Orders, Personal Checks, Business Checks, Cashier Checks and even straight Wampum. And of course, I honor basically all the payment services: Billpoint, PayPal, BidPay and PayDirect, with PayPal being perhaps the most convenient for both Buyer and Seller. My personal preference, though, is plain old checks and Money Orders. That may seem a little old fashioned, but online payment services are actually quite costly. Did you know that in most cases the Seller winds up paying PayPal and Billpoint more than the amount paid to eBay in Final Value Fees? Believe me, that's a fact. Online payment services are very convenient but they do drive up the costs for Sellers, so eventually this winds up costing all of us a little bit more. Please feel free to contact me directly via email at LindaGHTX@aol.com I Guarantee Total Satisfaction -- if you are unhappy with your purchase for any reason just return the item and I will refund all you've paid plus reimburse you for return shipping.

Each plate has a clasp on the back of the plate so that it can be hung on the wall and a small built in base so it can stand upright on its own. The plates originally sold for $44 directly from Bradford Exchange. This plate will make a great Christmas gift. I HAVE ALL FIVE PLATES FROM THIS SERIES AND WILL LIST THEM ALL. Winning bid can pay by BillPoint, PayPal, money order, or check. Please allow 5 days for personal checks to clear before I ship the item. PLEASE SUBMIT PAYMENT WITHIN 10 DAYS AFTER AUCTION HAS CLOSED. I pack the items carefully; however, I cannot be held responsible for lost or broken items. Buyer can purchase insurance for an extra $1.10 to $3.00 depending on the value of the shipment. Shipping is by Priority Mail. The plates are easily twice to three times the weight of a typical Bradford Exchange plate so shipping 1 plate is $6.45; 2 plates are $8.35 and 3 plates are $10.00. I try to give an accurate description of the condition so you know what you are purchasing. Please feel free to E-mail me prior to bidding if you have any questions. Will do my best to get the plates out as fast as possible, but shipping during the holidays can be slow. Thank you for looking.

Please read all stipulations below, if you cannot honor or abide by them, do not waste our time or yours. We do not enjoy giving negatives or receiving threatening mail about an impending negative or non paying bidder process, but to be fair we have guidelines that we follow and make perfectly clear in our auctions. I really regret having to implement these stipulations in our auctions, but irresponsible bidders and timewasters have made it necessary. Those buyers who do not seem to understand that we do not take checks also have made this necessary. For those of you who are responsible bidders, who read the entire auction before they bid, please know that this is not aimed at you and that we welcome you and your purchase. I have met a lot of really nice courteous bidders and sellers here and hope to keep meeting you all in the future. For you repeat buyers, thank you for your trust in me and I really do value your business. 1. we use a set shipping and insurance fee . This fee will take in oversize boxes if this pertains to the auction, and delivery confirmation and insurance on all items. It does also include a handling fee in the amount which will take care of our expenses in getting the item to you safe and sound, extra insurance and sales tax. We try very hard to be as close to the shipping and insurance as we can,but still allow extra for the above. Shipping will be on the Saturday after payment is recieved. Shipping will be by Priority mail insurance , delivery confirmation and handling fee will mean a total shipping price of 6.50 for this item. non US bidders will need to pay more. Please contact us to make sure that we mail to your country before you bid and to check out the shipping and insurance costs. There are some countries that do not allow insurance and therefore we are not able to send to this country. 2. . I do reserve the right to not accept bids from those with negative feed-back ; history of non payment; late payments; lack of communications or unreasonable demands or retractions. If you snipe at the last minute, we will hold to these same standards and may not honor your bid for the same reasons. All bidders are held to the same standards to be fair. Regardless of feedback or buyer/seller status. 3. Payment is fine money order or cashier check. We are no longer taking checks. If you send a check, it will NOT be considered payment and will either be destroyed or returned with your merchandise upon proper payment. We also take paypal payments from verified accounts which unfortunately does not include other countries at present. You would send to momahedger@aol.com. 4. We do participate in the NPB process. 5. I leave feedback when I know that the buyer has recieved their item. I do not need for the buyer to leave it first, but I do need to know that the item has arrived. I rate my buyers on their payment, on their communication with us during and after the auction and their reading and following our guidelines in the auction. Many sellers do it different. As soon as I know that the item has arrived I will go and leave feedback . Ruby Lane Antiques &amp; Collectibles``1007712500``1008576500``momastreasures``

I belive the books and the free market speak for themselves (IN MOST CASES), so why thrust a imaginary support level on the auction? The cgc census report is now avalable on their web site, cgccomics.com (as of 7-12-01). I strongly encourage all serious bidders to visit this site, especially when bidding on more expensive or scarce books. Many of the books I offer up on ebay and on my website are of the highest slabbed grades at present, or in a good number of times-the ONLY book of it's kind to have been graded. This information is powerful when buying, selling or bidding. I am a CGC Charter member, and AACC member. My grading is guaranteed,-refering to unslabbed books, naturally- I have been a collector and seller/dealer for over 35 years. Many references available, if you need them. If not satisfied I will return a full refund for the books, as long as they are returned in original condition. All items packed securely. Shipping is $6 in the Cont.USA. Insurance is extra-$2 and up-(for merchadise $100 or more) depending on price of book, and I will not be responsible for uninsured books(anything over $100). I usually ship ONCE a week depending on volume, (sometimes more), using either USPS-priority mail, OR Fed Ex ground, either takes 2-4 days. All CGC books are non returnable, I will warrenty against any cracks in the slab, though. Most (USPS) books sent by certified. Overseas postage is at LEAST $15 per package, so please keep this in mind if you are bidding from overseas, or just please refrain from bidding. Also, most bidders are honorable, but do not bid if you are unsure that you can make payment and agree to terms. For USA orders, you may combine up to 5 CGC books and up to 12 non CGC books per order. Thanks for looking, have fun, and please visit my web site and other auctions.

Large, inside bubble on the shoulder. Very small chip where the vertical edge meets the base. Ground mouth, to accomodate the ground stopper. By the way, the stopper has concentric rays on top, fairly fancy. The stopper is slightly hazy, with a tiny nick on the edge.

It is a Ceramic candle holder of a mouse cuddled up in an xmas stocking, next to a pot belly stove.

The box has been in storage for several years but as it was on the top, it is still in excellent condition with it's full gloss..

1045471787``1``$14.95``$14.95``DAVIS EMBOSSED OPEN PONTIL MEDICINE BOTTLE``Here is a classic open pontiled aqua medicine bottle. It is 5 1/8 inches tall and has 3 sunken panels. It is embossed: DAVIS arched in a recessed square on the front and VEGETABLE on left side and PAIN KILLER on the other side. Has a nice applied double collar and beveled edges. Similar to Greer's but this size not listed. Digger Odell states in his book, Pontil Medicine Encyclopedia, that Perry Davis was a carpenter and discovered this formula and began selling this medicine in a basket-What a change in occupations. Digger does not list this size either. This medicine was also referred to in the classic novel of Tom Sawyer. The condition is good-it is dug with a nice haze. No chips, dings or cracks in the glass. The glass is crude and has wonderful whittle. The base is the real odd feature-has a horseshoe type key mold, an x on each side with a nice open pontil in the center. Would make a nice addition to any Early pre-civil war or Pontiled Medicine bottle collection. No reserve. Thank you for looking at this item and God Bless.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING TO BE DETERMINED AT END OF AUCTION AND WILL DEPEND ON BUYER LOCATION. Please see shipping costs/methods and insurance requirements below. For larger items please click here to email us for a quote. All breakables and items valued near and above $50 will have insurance required. If the item is shipped via FedEx this coverage is automatic up to $100 in value, 40_ for each additional $100 coverage. For USPS delivery, $1.25 up to $50, $1.00 each additional $100. All uninsured parcels become the responsiblity of the bidder once said parcel is duly delivered to the appropriate carrier. DELIVERY CAN BE MADE WITHIN A 250 MILE RADIUS OF OUR STORE ON OUR LARGER ITEMS. PLEASE EMAIL FOR A DELIVERY QUOTE The following types of payment are accepted: money orders, personal checks*, and all major credit cards. Payment must be received within 10 business days in order to avoid negative feedback and being reported to eBay as a non-payer. This will also expedite shipping of your item. * All returned checks will be accessed a $25 service fee. Ma residents pay a 5% sales tax. SHIPPING METHODS: The bidder may at any time request the shipping service of their choice, to which will be added an appropriate handling fee. MEDIA: We have been shipping media items (records, books, etc.) by Media mail, but have experienced slow delivery times, so we are trying to move away from this service. Smaller, light-weight media items over 13 ozs. are still quoted for Media mail and the bidder may request a different delivery service. However, we WILL NOT be held responsible for the long amount of time any Media mail shipment may take. SMALLER ITEMS: Other smaller items up to 13 ozs. are shipped first class. All other items are shipped either Priority mail or FedEx. Usually anything over a few pounds is shipped via FedEx, hence the higher costs. However, their exemplary service is guarenteed, carries automatic insurance up to $100 in value, and is trackable with out additional cost. Any item shipped through the USPS Priority service without requesting additional services such as delivery confirmation can not be tracked, nor will we be held responsibility for its not being delivered (see insurance disclaimer above). LARGER ITEMS: Larger items such as furniture and such are shipped either with BAX Global or a local mover we use who makes east coast runs every two-three weeks. HANDLING FEES: Since our shipping department needs to eat (and we require him to wear shoes, please! ), and shipping materials do cost money (really!) all items have an appropriate handling fee. Basically, the more time and care taken to prepare an item for safe transport, the higher the fee. We do our best to provide both cost effective and careful handling of packaging your item. This fee is not negotiable and is usually reflected in all posted S&amp;H charges, or added to shipping quotes for larger items.

NM 1970 ASTONISHING TALES 1 - 8 : KAZAR &amp; DR DOOM QUESTIONS: click here to send an e-mail CONDITION : NEAR MINT OPENING BID: $9.99 HOW TO PAY? MONEY ORDER &amp; PAYPAL HOW TO SHIP? I ship via United States Postal Service for both domestic and international. You pay only the cost required to ship. I do not believe in padding auctions by adding unjustified extra charges. I don't like it when people do it to me, so I won't do it to you. PICTURES: Click on each to get a larger view. _ #1 #7 HONESTY POLICY I have met people in my store who won books on E-Bay that were nowhere near the condition described. It angers me as a seller because it ruins the reputations of dealers as a whole. Simply put, it hurts our market by driving away customers. How Do I Grade? I look at every book and grade it according to six categories: front cover, back cover, corners, edges, spine &amp; staples, interior pages. I give a complete description of each of these sections noting any flaws or defects. Also, I include large scans of the front and back covers. When I have completed the auction page, I am satisfied that you know exactly what you are bidding on and that there will be no surprises at auction's end. So what about returns? At first I offered returns on books. Then I quickly discovered that some people would outbid everyone else by an excessively high amount just to get a look at the book, then ask for a return if they decided they didn't want it. I no longer offer returns. I am confident in my grading and description and have never had a complaint about either. If you are not sure that you want the book then don't bid on it. COMPLETE DESCRIPTION: _ All books have come from the same collection and have received the same care over the years. Title: Astonishing Tales Featuring Kazar and Dr. Doom Issue(s) &amp; Date(s): #1, August 1970 - #8, October 1971 Double feature books. Issues feature work by Kirby, Wood and Barry Smith. Appearances by Black Panther, Kraven, Nixon &amp; Red Skull. This run represents the first Mavel Villain solo series. Front Cover: Strong gloss, bright color, clean white.

Wear at upper and lower left corners of issue #8. Edges: Sharp, clear definition. Spine &amp; Staples: Strong, straight and clean. A few crease lines near bottom staple of issue #4.

1045984485``2``$60.00``$66.00``HULK 111-200 (29 issues) VF/NM Very Nice!!``You're bidding on a VERY NICE run of ol' Greenskin. Included are issues: 111,112,116,123,124,126,127,128,129,130,131,133,134,136,137,140,141,142,143,145,146,148,149,151,152,153,155, and #200.. Plus Incredible Hulk Special #4. All are in BEAUTIFUL condition.. really nice comics. The only exception to this would be Issue # 200 which has some dark scuffing amidst the white background. Amazing the newest one is the worst.. and even it's prob at least a Fine grade comic. I believe issue 141 is the first appearance of Doc Samson.. saw it on here for about $50 all by itself and prob not as good as this one.. It looks about perfect to me. Issues 123,124,129,130, and 131 have store date stamps on the light part of the covers.. but nothing major.. other than that they appear to be NM. It would take me forever to look at each and every page of this many comics but the few I opened and checked only showed to be a little off-white around the edges.. and near the center. Nothing out of the ordinary for a 30 year old comic. Saw no creases or any other obvious blemishes.. other than those with the store dates. All are bagged and boarded.. and rather than risk damaging them in scans I chose to scan them in the covers so if you see a little &quot;shimmer&quot; .. it's the scan... not the comic. I really don't think you'll be dissapointed in any way with the condition of these comics. If so just tell me within 3 days and I'll refund your money.. minus shipping. I think that's a fair proposition. Trying to describe these as best I can so you'll know what you're getting before you bid. I haven't researched anything as to their true value.. I'll leave it to some savy bidders to do the research and bid accordingly. I'll start the bidding at $60 which I believe is a steal for this quality and quantity. I hate to set any limits at all but I feel 2 dollars a book is a pretty good buy.Sentimentally they're worth a lot more to me.. a part of my youth I held on to for all these years. You probably can't get that many brand new comics at that price. Much less true collector items. Anyways.. that's the deal. Hope you like what you see. Will accept PayPal, Money Orders, and Cashiers Check. Shipping will be a flat 7 dollars which will include: Well packed USPS Priority Shipping, Tracking # and insurance covering the total bid price. May cost more to do all this.. will be a fairly heavy package but I lean towards the buyer when it comes to shipping charges. I'm a buyer myself :) Thanks for looking and HAVE A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS!!

1046065453``0``$24.99``$24.99``Oriental Batik:Wall Hanging-Dragon ,Phoenix 3``China has a long history of batik production dating back to the sixth century. Today you can still find batik being done by the ethnic people in Guizhou Province, in the South-West of China. Here the Miao, Bouyei and Gejia people use a dye resist method that is different from the Han Chinese. The Miao place great emphasis on their costumes which are made up of decorative fabrics which they achieve by pattern weaving and wax resist. Almost all the Miao decorate hemp and cotton (not silk) by applying hot wax then dipping the cloth in an indigo dye. The cloth is then used for skirts, panels on jackets, aprons and baby carriers. Indigo is used chiefly for the basic cloth throughout Guizo to give dark blues. A paste is made from the harvested plants which have been soaked in a wooden barrel. Wax resisted fabric was probably one of the earliest forms of decoration in Guizhou as all the materials were at hand. Beeswax is the main ingredient but other resins or wax are possibly added. The wax resist never exploits crackle, the aim is to produce a clear image and beeswax is both tenacious and flexible. The wax is often heated in a little pot, resting in hot embers. Once applied the wax appears black on the fabric but at the end of the process the wax is removed from the fabric. The fabric is then rinsed in cool water and air dried. The beeswax can be reused. The usual tools for applying wax are of copper and brass with bamboo handles. They are made from 2 small triangular pieces of metal, their apexes bound to a bamboo holder by copper wire. It is held like a pen either upright or at a slant to the cloth which is laid flat on a board. This tool lends itself to the drawing of straight or slightly curving lines. The Miao, Gejia and Bouyei girls are highly skilled at batik. They use very finely drawn circular and double spiral designs representing the horns of the water buffalo, symbolising their ancestor's life and death. Girls start learning to produce batik from the age of 6 and 7 years. The finest work is found on baby carriers, sleeves of their jackets and skirts. The more traditional designs are geometric, where the most skilled wax resist reads as a fine blue line on a white ground. With the influence of the Han Chinese more figurative designs like flowers, birds, fish have been introduced over the centuries. This item is Dragon &amp; Phoenix (3) batik.Size:45 inches long and 45 inches wide.International shipping postage is 9 US $.Combine shipping postage can be reduced.BATIK CAN ONLY BE SENT ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.

This group of X men are mostly warehouse copies.Also note that this scan generally will overstate defects (Read what the buyer of a $1000.00 AF 15 recently said about our scan-nov 28 2001 feedback, or just to confirm read the Dec 3 2001 feedback of a VF Green Lantern purchase OR read what a buyer of a nm Thor said&quot;Pinpoint grading (an ebay rarity!) Recommend this seller.Dec 3 2001)).All grades are guarenteed within 0.5 of any grading service. The grade quoted above is an accurate grade reflecting the true condition of the book.(Any defect not revealed by the large scan will be discussed apart).The price is set so that you will be hard pressed to find as good a deal anywhere else.(This 33% bigger scan( than the books' actual size) magnifies and enlarges defects-it is like looking at the book through a magnification factor). Generally speaking the book possess's a solid intact spine with no splits;staples solidly in place;corners sharp;gloss and color deapth vivid,deep and close to new in appearance;only minor spine stress marks may exist(similar to thoses produced at original printing);overall a glossy off white to WHITE paged copy offered at an unbeatable initial bid ,with a LOW RESERVE(This low reserve allows our customers to use the buy it now feature.Many have missed out on previous books,and this feature usually prolongs the auction a bit longer to give everyone a chance to bid).As we have a large multiple grade inventory of Silver and Golden age books,many will be offered for sale in coming ads.There are many comics being auctioned off on Ebay this week.Combine auctions to save postage.THOUSANDS of other books are still to come including most Marvel and DC titles from 1960 -1972.Use the BUY IT NOW feature to end the auction and lock out the competition. We are multiple CBG award winners;EBAY Power sellers;and have 1000 total positive feedbacks(many multiple) since we began here about 2 years ago.Some may remember us for our full page Marvel adds starting in the 1980's.Our Marvel inventory is extensive and stocked in multiple conditions..Note.All our scans are &quot;High resolution&quot;.That means a magnified, extremley detailed scan which is about 33% LARGER than the actual size of the comic.( so, of course, defects appear about 1/3rd bigger,than if you were viewing the item right in front of you)..Why do we do this?Why do we want the comic to have all the defects OVERSTATED? Here are the reasons; 1)All defects are CLEARLY seen.(in our opinion a small scan is of no use-the grade can be anything). 2) By revealing all defects,you can grade based upon what you like or dislike about a book. 3) No two grades have the same defects,thus a large scan allows you to delineate the key aspects of the book. 4)A large scan will OVERSTATE defects.Defects appear LARGER than what you will see when you get the book.(This applies especially to creases(thicker than actual),and stress marks,and to a lesser extent to color tones,which may show gradations in color not visible with the naked eye).Most of our customers note that the book is nicer when it arrives than what this scan revealed(reasons;the scans bright flood light reveal evey single microscopic impact point,plus defects appear 33% larger.) 5)All our books are guaranteed to be in the same general grade range(within+/- 0.5) if the book is slabbed(within 14 days of purchase) 6) Full exchange privledges on any item purchased.within 7 days. 7) Shipping : Cost; 5.00 for less than 5 comics(priority mail with delivery confirmation) in North America NOTE ;Allow 2 weeks for material to reach you;we often beat that,but increased security screening by the post office can delay shipping time;we take full responsibility.... ..Questions and/or comments?

It is the: LENOX * HANCOCK GOLD * STAINLESS 5 PIECE PLACE SETTING!! BRAND NEW SET SKU #9862092!! RETAIL $120.00! This set is BRAND NEW! and each piece is individually wrapped and comes in the manufacturers packaging and box with all paperwork as if you had purchased it in the store. Included is a SALAD FORK, PLACE FORK, PLACE KNIFE, PLACE SPOON, and TEASPOON. The scan really is not that good as I just laid them on the scanner. You really cannot see the great detail in the gold accents, but trust me, its gorgeous. All pieces are new and flawless. Any lines, markes, dots, or imperfections seen are only from the scan and NOT the pieces. Please note that all the flatwear sets I offer on EBAY are NOT &quot;factory seconds&quot; nor are they &quot;factory recalls&quot;. EVERY set I sell are ORIGINAL AND AUTHENTIC and are the EXACT SAME items (same sku, model# etc..)as you would get if you purchased these in the finest stores. Because of my very low starting prices on these sets, I have had several emails inquiring about the authenticity of these settings. TRUST ME, these are the REAL DEAL, and you can verify them by taking them to any retailer to have them looked at. I have sold well over 250 premium flatwear sets in the last several months on EBAY so you can view my feedback for further assurance. I do not mean to dwell too long on this, but I know that there are alot of &quot;fake&quot; stuff offered so I just wanted to put your minds at ease. Nowback to the auction. This set sells for a minimum of $120.00 at Hetch's! Sure you may find it less than that at some warehouse type outlets, but I guarantee you won't find it cheaper than here! This is a very beautiful design and made by one of the BEST manufacturers of flatwear sets. Minimum is only $19.99 which is ridiculous. Someone will be very happy with this set. You should always have extra settings for unexpected guests, and this is an excellent and affordable way to obtain one without spending mucho money! Please view my flawless 600+ feedback and know that I am an honest and reputable seller. A lot of flatwear on EBAY are advertised as &quot;new condition&quot; but in reality has been in the seller's possession for quite some time. All my items are BRAND NEW and AUTHENTIC!! I HAVE 4 TOTAL SETS OF THIS PATTERN UP NOW ON EBAY IN CASE YOU NEED MORE! I also have other premium sets curretly up on EBAY, so please check them out. This item will be sent via Priority Mail for $4.50. Additional settings won, please add $1 per setting for combined S/H.
